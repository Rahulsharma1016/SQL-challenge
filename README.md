SQL Challenge

This project aims to analyze the employee data of Pewlett Hackard from the 1980s and 1990s. This project involves the creation and analysis of a database using PostgreSQL. The project includes the following steps:
1.	Designing an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD). (Data Modeling) 
2.	Manually writing SQL queries to create the tables in the database. (Data Engineering)
3.	Importing data from CSV files into the created tables.
4.	Writing SQL queries to answer specific analysis questions.(Data Analysis)



Data Engineering

Using my ERD, I manually wrote SQL queries to create each of the tables in the database. 
I created each of the six tables, defining all column names, data types, primary keys, and referencing any necessary foreign keys. After the tables were created,
 I used the built-in "Import/Export data..." tool in pgAdmin 4 to import the CSV files into the respective tables.

Data Analysis
Ans all the 8 questions, in this section
There are different queries to get the particular outputs which asked in the submission.
